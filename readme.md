# Neural Network with Red Language

## see http://redlcv.blogspot.com/2018/ for a short explanation 

This code is for educative purpose and was developped under macOS 10.14

Are included 3 files

neuralNN.red: a basic library for backpropagation algorithm 

neuraln1_5.red: graphical illustration of running network

neuraln2_2.red: code sample with hidden neurons calculation 

This is really illustrative and must be improved!
